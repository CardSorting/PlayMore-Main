These font files need to be replaced with the actual Magic: The Gathering fonts:

1. Beleren-Bold.woff2 - Used for card names and headers
2. Matrix-Regular.woff2 - Used for regular card text
3. MPlantin-Italic.woff2 - Used for flavor text

Due to licensing restrictions, these fonts need to be obtained separately and placed in this directory.

For development purposes, the system will fall back to the specified system fonts:
- Beleren falls back to: ui-serif, Georgia, Cambria, serif
- Matrix falls back to: ui-serif, Georgia, Cambria, serif  
- MPlantin falls back to: ui-serif, Georgia, Cambria, serif
